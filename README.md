# HelloNeoPixel

My introduction to controlling WS2812 individually-addressable
LEDs via a controller running MicroPython

## Tests

While `py.test` is included in this project's development
environment, the tests themselves are written using pure unittest,
as that's what's implemented in MicroPython, and the tests are intended
to be runnable directly on the microcontroller.

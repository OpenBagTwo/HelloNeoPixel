# Ghast

This is the code for an app-controlled model Minecraft
[ghast](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ghast) which
makes ghast noises, can be toggled between passive and angry modes,
and can be triggered to shoot fireballs.

## Technical Design

### Components (Parts List)

* **Main Controller: ESP32-WROOM-32** development board. For
  once, it actually made sense to use an ESP32 over a cheaper
  82xx, as the non-REPL UART bus on the 8266 is TX only
  (no RX), and the only other WiFi-enabled MicroPython board
  (the PyBoard) is considerably more expensive. Smaller
  form factors exist, but the enclosure was large enough to
  accommodate the full-sized dev board, so why not?
  
* **Audio / SD Card Module: DFRobot DFPlayer Mini** (clone).
  A pretty nifty board that lets you load mp3 files onto
  an SD card and then play them either via buttons or
  UART. The clones are notoriously poor build quality--out
  of five I ordered, only _one_ had functional UART. On
  the plus side, the kit I ordered came with an 8Î© speaker.
  
* **LEDs:**
  * 2x **5mm Red LEDs** for the eyes
  * 1x **single WS2812 NeoPixel** (clone) addressable RGB LED
    for the mouth
